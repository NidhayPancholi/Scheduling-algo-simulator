<h4> JOB SCHEDULING ALGORITHMS </h4>

<h5> Summary</h5>
Job scheduling is the process of allocating system resources to many different tasks by an operating system (OS). The system handles prioritized job queues that are awaiting CPU time and it should determine which job to be taken from which queue and the amount of time to be allocated for the job. This type of scheduling makes sure that all jobs are carried out fairly and on time.
